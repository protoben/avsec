  - This one needs to be investigated further. It is unclear how many items are included in an order, and how many pins. A question has been sent to the seller about the details. The product page threatens that if the purchase is not properly parameterized, they "will random Send to your."
  - Needed:
    - 1x 7-pin DF13-DuPont
    - 5x 6-pin DF13-DuPont
    - 1x 5-pin DF13-DuPont
    - 6x 4-pin DF13-DuPont
    - 1x 3-pin DF13-DuPont
  - Order details: This product is sold by two vendors on amazon. M-KAPONG is located in Thailand, and has a cheaper per-price unit. It needs to be noted which seller is filling the order, and a message needs to be sent to that vendor with the purchase order number and the above itemized list of the pinouts we need, so they don't send us an assortment of 14 random cables.
